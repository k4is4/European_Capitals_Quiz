# European Capitals Quiz

I made this quiz in order to practice Flask and MongoDB. Both the high scores and the list of countries and capitals are stored in the database. In addition I got to refresh my memory with some simple HTML and CSS.

# How To Play

You can take the quiz at kaisaweb.pythonanywhere.com. 
Click START QUIZ to start.
Type in the capital of the country in question and click SUBMIT or you can press Enter to submit your answer.
After submitting, a new question will appear. At the top of the page you will also see the correct answer for the previous question.
Do not add the definite article 'the' or the word 'city' even if they are commonly used for the capital in question.
Do not worry about letter casing, the quiz is not case sensitive.
After you have answered all 46 questions you will see your total score. If you made it to the top 10 you will have the possibility to save your score to the High Score Table.
